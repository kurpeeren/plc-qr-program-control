# BARIDA GROUP Internship Project: QR Code-Based Automation System

This project introduces an automation system developed by Recep Arslan and Eren KÃ¼rpe during their internship at BARIDA GROUP. In this system, commands encoded as QR codes are decoded into 14-byte data and sent to the PLC for execution. The project integrates Siemens S7-1200 PLC, Siemens V90 servo drive, and a valve.

## Project Details

In this project, we developed an automation system that processes commands transmitted through QR codes and executes specific actions on the PLC. The project incorporates the following main components:

- **Siemens S7-1200 PLC:** The central control unit where data from QR codes is processed and actions are executed.
- **Siemens V90 Servo Drive:** The drive used to control the servo motor's movement.
- **Valve:** Integrated to control specific flows within the system.
- **C# Interface:** A C# interface developed for image processing. This interface reads QR codes, deciphers the data, and transmits it to the PLC.

The project has two main modes: Manual and Automatic. In the manual mode, specific movements of the servo motor and valve can be controlled. In the automatic mode, predefined working algorithms are used for movement.

Our project combines industrial automation with image processing, offering a unique perspective. For detailed technical information and code examples, please refer to the GitHub repository.

## Project Benefits

This project brings together dynamic programming and various camera solutions to offer a range of additional benefits:

1. **Various Camera Options:** The project has the capability to integrate with low-cost webcam cameras or different camera solutions. It can flexibly adjust various operations based on QR codes read from products or product carriers.

2. **Dynamic Tasks:** The system can perform dynamic tasks based on QR codes embedded within or determined by program features. This allows for quickly implementing different process scenarios and optimizing workflows.

3. **Data-Driven Processing:** QR codes, by carrying data, enable dynamic modification of programs and operations. This makes it possible to carry out customized processes based on the type or characteristics of products.

4. **Speed and Flexibility:** With various camera options and dynamic programming, it enables quick and flexible operations. It facilitates quick responsiveness in mass production of products or adapting processes in different scenarios.

5. **High Efficiency:** Dynamic tasks and flexible camera options enhance the efficiency of workflows. The automatic program change rapidly processes data and enhances productivity.

This project presents an example of processing products dynamically in various scenarios and adjusting programs flexibly. It offers a valuable solution for those looking to optimize workflows and enhance efficiency.
